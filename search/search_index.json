The server uses this to identify the client when it reconnects. If you do not specify a client ID, the system automatically generates it. \n         \n         STRING \n         No \n         No \n     \n     \n         topic \n         The topic from which WSO2 SP receives events via MQTT. Multiple topics can be specified as a list of comma separated values.This is a mandatory parameter. \n         \n         STRING \n         No \n         No \n     \n     \n         quality.of.service \n         The quality of service provided by the MQTT client. The possible values are as follows. 0 : The MQTT client sends each event to WSO2 SP only once. It does not receive an acknowledgement when an event is delivered, and the events are not stored.Events may get lost if the MQTT client is disconnected or if the server fails.This is the fastest method in which events are received via MQTT. 1 : The MQTT client sends each event to WSO2 SP at least once. If the MQTT client does not receive an acknowledgement to indicate that the event is delivered, it sends the event again. 2 : The MQTT client sends each event to WSO2 SP only once. The events are stored until the WSO2 SP receives them. This is the safest, but the slowest method of receiving events via MQTT. \n         1 \n         STRING \n         Yes \n         No \n     \n     \n         clean.session \n         This is an optional paramater. If this parameter is set to  true , the subscriptions made by the MQTT client during a session expire when the session ends,and they need to be recreated for the next session. If this parameter is set to  false , all the information relating to the MQTT client's connection to the broker (e.g., the specific topics to which the client has subscribed) are saved after a session. Thus, when a session ends and restarts, the connection is re-established with the same information. The default value is  true . \n         true \n         BOOL \n         Yes \n         No \n     \n     \n         keep.alive \n         The maximum number of seconds the connection between the MQTT client and the broker should be maintained without any events being transferred. Once this time interval elapses without any event transfers, the connection is dropped. The default value is 60. \n         60 \n         INT \n         Yes \n         No \n     \n     \n         connection.timeout \n         The maximum number of seconds that the MQTT client should spend attempting to connect to the MQTT broker. Once this time interval elapses, a timeout takes place. \n         30 \n         INT \n         Yes \n         No \n       Examples  EXAMPLE 1  @source(type= mqtt , url=  tcp://localhost:1883 , topic= mqtt_topic , clean.session= true ,quality.of.service=  1 , keep.alive=  60 ,connection.timeout= 30 @map(type= xml ))Define stream BarStream (symbol string, price float, volume long);  This query receives events from the  mqtt_topic  topic via MQTT,and processes them to the BarStream stream.",
